Reispar Academy is glad to bring this project idea into fruition on the Corona virus case. This project is a Real Time Analytics Web application on the Covid-19 across the globe.
It combines the distinct skills of Software Engineering, Data Science, Data Analytics, Programming, DataOps and Project Management into one web application. The core objective of this web application is to aid in good governance by making live data available for both private and government agencies, individuals, institutions and businesses across the world.

The web application is based on an API, which we are making open and available to the public. The descriptive data & visual analytics reveals trends in the growth cases of the virus. The team working on this project operated remotely to deliver it.

The API technology scraps data from the source site at an interval of 7 minutes. 

For more analysis and research using our API, see more details on the API documentation website:
